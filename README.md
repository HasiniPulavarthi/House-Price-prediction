# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using machine Learning.  
It follows a complete ML workflow: data loading, preprocessing, train-test split, model training, and evaluation.

The model is built using the **Boston House Price Dataset** and trained with an **XGBoost Regressor**.
